Description (project  )

EduSphere is an interactive web-based platform that offers STEM experiments using interactive 3D models. It enables students with limited resources to perform virtual experiments in subjects like Physics and Chemistry. This platform offers an accessible, safe and engaging learning experience for students to explore science concepts interactively.

Key Features
>Interactive Simulations: Perform physics experiments like Ohmâ€™s law.
>Quizzes and Assessments: Testing knowledge with experiment, getting instant feedback.
>User friendly design: Mobile-friendly interface for students in rural areas.
>Dynamic 3D visualization: It allows students to observe and interact with working models.
>Affordable and accessible: Does not require expensive equipments like VR sets.
>AI companion: Powered by OpenAI API to guide students, answer their queries and grasp concepts according to their syllabus(9th-12th grade).

Technologies Used

>Python
>Flask
>OpenAPI
>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
>Gradio

Future Enhancements

1. Add more experiments in Physics and Chemistry
2. Introduce collaborative features
3. For group learning integrate VR(Virtual Reality)features.

Description (project  2)

Develop an NLP-based solution capable of analyzing English sentences,
identifying words, and their context, to facilitate effective and context-aware
translation into Indian Sign Language. This solution aims to bridge the gap
between English and ISL by parsing sentences and capturing the context,

ultimately enhancing communication accessibility for the Deaf and hard-of-
hearing communities.

Features :- 
Context Detection:

>Identifies the meaning of words based on their usage in a sentence.
 Appends context (e.g., "_geography", "_general") to words for better ISL grammar representation.
 POS Filtering:

>Uses Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging to remove unnecessary/common words (e.g., "the", "and", "is").
 Sequence Reduction:

>Reduces complex phrases into single, contextually meaningful words (e.g., "feeling too good" â†’ "sad_general").
 Customizable Dictionary:

>A flexible context_dict allows easy addition of words and their contexts for expanding the model.
 Tokenization and Tagging:

 >Breaks sentences into individual tokens and assigns POS tags using NLTK.

technologies used :-

Python:

Core programming language for building the ISL translator.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):

Tokenization: Breaking sentences into words.
POS Tagging: Assigning Part-of-Speech tags to words for filtering and context detection.
Command-Line Interface:

For user interaction and input/output handling.
Custom Dictionary:

Built-in Python data structures (e.g., dictionaries) for mapping words to contexts.
Prompt Engineering:

Used to design logical rules for context detection and ISL grammar conversion.
